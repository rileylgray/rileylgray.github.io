                    <h4>Dodge Square</h4>
                    <p>A simple game made in java, with the goal of dodging 
                        and staying alive as long as possible. I keep adding to the
                        game so stay with me. The game includes major and minor 
                        enemies. Some chase you, some shoot at you, some just
                        bounce around hoping to hit you. You can upgrade yourself
                        but each upgrade reduces your score so play smart and score big.</p>

                <p class="intro">My Name is Riley Gray. I am a Sheridan 
                    College student in the Software Development and Network
                    Engineering program. </p>
            </div>

                <div class="col span-1-of-2">
                    <p> After graduating high school, I headed straight to Humber
                        College and enrolled in the Electrical Techniques program. 
                        This was a one-year program in which I graduated with honors.
                        After this program and a few months of work I decide to head 
                        to Sheridan College to pursue software development. I am 
                        currently in my 2nd year of my 3-year program and have 
                        already learned languages like java, HTML, CSS, javascript, and
                        MySQL. I am learning even more through Sheridan and my 
                        own pursuits.</p>

                <div class="col span-1-of-2">
                    <p>
                        My work experience in the IT field is just starting with
                        me landing my first co-op job at the County of Wellington.
                        But before that I spent 4 years working at Dixie Orchards 
                        providing assistance to customers. 2 of these years was 
                        spent as a manager training and guiding new employees. I
                        also spent a period in my life working as an electrician
                        apprentice for Sommerville electric. Although a short time
                        I learnt many transferable skills like teamwork and problem
                        solving that will aid me in my future.

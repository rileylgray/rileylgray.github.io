                    <p>
                        A simple game made in Java, with the goal of dodging 
                        and staying alive as long as possible. I keep adding to the
                        game so stay with me. The game includes major and minor 
                        enemies. Some chase you, some shoot at you, some just
                        bounce around hoping to hit you. You can upgrade yourself
                        but each upgrade reduces your score so play smart and score big.

                       This is my first real attempt at creating a game 
                    for use on an android device. I created the pixel art

                    College student in the Software Development and Network
                    Engineering program. </p>

                <div class="col span-1-of-2">
                    <p> After graduating high school, I headed straight to Humber
                        College and enrolled in the Electrical Techniques program. 
                        This was a one-year program in which I graduated with honours.
                        After this program and a few months of work I decide to head 
                        to Sheridan College to pursue software development. I am 
                        currently in my 3rd year of my 3-year program and have 
                        already learned languages like Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
                        MySQL. I am learning even more through Sheridan and my 
                        own pursuits.</p>

                        My work experience now includes two 4 month co-op terms.
                        The first at the county of wellington and the second at 
                        the Region of Halton. Both I was given excellent reviews
                        by my supervisors. During these terms I was working as a
                        IT support technician. This was excellent experience but I 
                        hope to find a developer job in the future.

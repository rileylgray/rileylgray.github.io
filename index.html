                one was either for school or to teach myself something new. 
                I enjoy being able to create almost anything from nothing and
                coding gives me that opportunity. </p>

                    <h4>Dodge Square</h4>
                    <p>A simple game made in java, with the goal of dodging 
                    and staying alive as long as possible. I keep adding to the
                    game so stay with me. The game includes major and minor 
                    enemies. Some chase you, some shoot at you, some just
                    bounce around hoping to hit you. You can upgrade yourself
                    but each upgrade reduces your score so play smart and score big.</p>
